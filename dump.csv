Item Ideas,"* Drunkard’s Hat, A fine straw or town hat, user knows the location of the nearest alcoholic beverage.
* Coin of Certainty, a brass coin that always lands on heads.
* Bolts of Seeking. A crossbow bolt that automatically seeks out and targets the nearest person when fired. Please note this is almost always the person who fired the crossbow.
* Chalk of Doors, A stick of chalk with a sprinkle of rainbow in the lime. Allows the user to cast misty step as an action by drawing a chalk door on the wall and stepping through. 3/3 uses.
* Cloak of Grace, Allows user to cast feather fall once per day, billows majestically at all other times. On natural 1 rolls the cloak will get caught in something.
* I'm about to give one of my players a +1 flail that's going to drop from a mimic. What the player won't know until he rolls a Nat20 on an attack is that the flail is actually a baby mimic that opens up its maw and clamps down on the target's body, but on a nat one the mimic will clamp down on the player and will need to make a strength check to pry it off or he won't be able to fight with it.
* The Wolf’s Fang: This +1 magical longsword – with an ivory wolf’s head pommel – identifies its bearer as a friend to wolves, who will not attack the wielder unless provoked. 
* Moondancer: This +1 magical rapier is made from glittering silver steel that never rusts. Its hilt is inlaid with mother of pearl stars. When Moondancer moves through the air, the tip of the blade leaves traces of silvery light behind it. 
* Ceramite Shortsword: This +1 magical shortsword is made from magically hardened porcelain, inlaid with pale blue images of swallows in flight. The blade is impossibly sharp, but brittle. On a critical hit, roll an additional damage die. On a 1, the blade shatters into a thousand pieces and the air is momentarily filled with birdsong. 
* Prospector’s Blade: This +1 magical broadsword is of dwarven design. When the tip of this wide, squat bronze sword is tapped twice against a nonmagical metal, stone, or other mineral, the wielder learns its type. 
* Star Iron: This +1 magical longsword was forged from a meteorite. Its blade is a dark, shimmering blue, streaked with black and gold. Under starlight, the blade glows softly and feels lighter, gaining the finesse property until dawn. 
* Talon of the Crow Lord: This +1 magical longsword has a hilt adorned with feathers wrought from silver. When you attune to this weapon you can speak to and understand all crows, ravens, magpies, and other corvids, who periodically seek you out to make tiny offerings of shiny trinkets and baubles. 
* Aeolian Edge: This +1 magical rapier is exceptionally light. So light, in fact, that it will gently float away unless held or weighed down. When drawn, the bearer is surrounded by a momentary gust of wind that causes their hair and clothes to billow impressively. 






Think about the Origin, Aesthetic, and Location of a +1 magic sword. Express its past in the craftsmanship, or in the place where it is found. Do this right and your player hasn’t just picked up a slightly better pointy stick: they’ve acquired a piece of history, a riddle from the past to solve. 

Giving your cleric a holy sword forged by an order of nuns to slay the demon that tormented their monastery, with a blade forged from melted down holy symbols and a hilt adorned with wax purity seals and scraps of holy scripture is a hell of a lot more evocative than saying “you find a +1 magic longsword.

<<GMNote ""Possible Last Breath - Split, Kharazan vs Molten Core, whats the At Cost?

He was taken from his home village at a very young age by [[Osfire Fernbridge]] and was given some training in the ways of Magic. He quickly realised this was not his home and in his opinion he was being used so he escaped with [[Cas Kesmick]], [[Balvar Muzrald]] and [[Zaglo Kobald]], and he has not looked back since.

Grimoire, in an Arcane script, taught by the Halflings from the [[Acolytes of the Great Flame]], handled by a non magic user, produces a tingling affect within the hands, opening the book, the user will see the text swirl and disappear. (Energy must be 'channelled' into the book in order to get the text to remain.)

While he prepares his spells, there is a warm light that emanates from the book and a low hum can be heard within a few feet.

When he casts spells, there is lots of hand wavering and he often uses a component of some kind as he thinks they help make his spells more powerful.

After he escaped, he saw [[Erol]] perform in a tavern, he was amazed at this performance and how different it was from normal behaviour and decided he should listen when [[Erol]] told him what was socially acceptable and what wasn't.

As a child [[Rask]] went into [[Tomes re Udoka]] in [[Komozaa-oka]]  and 'borrowed' the only copy of [[Raising Dragons 4 Dummies]], on the inside cover it is clearly marked as the property of [[Tomes re Udoka]], when [[Rask]] found out that Lukk could read, he asked him to read the book, at this point [[Lukk]] found the marking on the inside cover and now wants [[Rask]] to return it.

Three members of [[Acolytes of the Great Flame]] was in the area looking for the escaped students, after looking in the [[Swamp of Turatil]] after a tip off from some pirates he headed to [[Komozaa-oka]] to follow up on the tip off. [[Lukk]] was lucky and spotted the cultists before they spotted him, after a quick chat and a plan with [[Tirgeth]] they managed to lure two of them away and isolate and remove them from the equation, unfortunately the other one escaped into the crowd. [[Lukk]] now feels he owes [[Tirgeth]].

Maisie Starhammer,"[img[https://nalonar.eaglesroost.org/images/tokens/Maisie Starhammer.png]]

<<GMNote ""Possible Last Breath - deepholm?, whats the At Cost?

BODY: Relatively short but very stocky and muscular. A few scars on her arms and one on her right cheek. She does sport a well-kept and short beard along with hair that is kept tied back

EYES: Deep blue. They have a hard edge to them

VOICE: Crisp enunciation with a broad accent. Does talk at around a billion miles an hour when excited.

DEMEANOUR: Doesn't take anyone's nonsense, can seem a little abrasive, but she does have a soft streak.

Signature Weapon is a Ancient Hammer that is well crafted and glows when in the presence of [[Strakara]], who was it made, when, why?

After finding herself beset by foes, her last breath struggling to find its way into her lungs, enemy's all around, she feels a burning sensation at the core of her being, the burning sensation seams to burn away her exhaustion and she is able to win the day, as she looks around she sees [[Shol-Tak]] standing on a small hill behind her wreathed in fire. She feels in her core that he is the one responsible for this and knows she owes him. She swears a dwarven debt, to protect him for as long as [[Shol-Tak]] deems her to be useful.

She was traveling with [[Radrick]] as a hired merc, after watching them throw [[Lukk]] overboard for not being able to pay for his passage, she thought that it was a bit unfair and excessive, she had a disagreement and a falling out with [[Radrick]] and after the trip and re encountering [[Lukk]] she thinks he needs to toughen up.

[[Maisie Starhammer]] has never heard of anything good coming from having a pet BEAR, and is convinced that [[Tirgeth]] having Dobbi is an accident waiting to happen.

During the fight with [[Rask]] the last of her dwarven ale from home was spilled, [[Rask]] has been unable to find anything that qualifies to repay the debt.

His body is scarred with battle wounds. Several of which glow red.
His Eyes are searing, with just the occasional flicker.
His Voice is deep, with a habitual touch of snarl.
His Demeanour is contemptuous and slightly angry.
He wears little but a few burnt rags. The observant may notice an [[Orlon Army Patch]] amongst the rags, specifically belonging to the [[Okat Regulars]].

''//Make your sacrifices now and protect the future! May your children rest easy and safe, rather than damning us for the seeds of evil we failed to stop //''

Was at [[The Battle of Okat-Oork]], after the victory the Kingdom, instead of doubling down and attacking the gnomes build the [[The Great Greenhouse of Lounging]], in between frustration and disgust, turning to Anger, Shol-Tak thinks the kingdom has sewn their own destruction, committing to a path of idleness which will lead to a path of decay and has walked away from the [[Okat Regulars]] and the [[Kingdom of Orlon]] in general.

While traveling in [[Gronzezzeg]], joined a band of Mercenary's, during a skirmish/battle at a fortified camp of [[Onuk]], [[Rask]] was surprised to see the fire leave a burning building and surround him and the fleeing ""knights"" (bandits) allowing him to slaughter them in Glory.

In his travels, he encountered [[Maisie Starhammer]] holding a bridge against multiple aggressors, she was holding, but just, mostly through strength of will, out of respect for that strength he sacrificed his Amenity to all Gnomes to the fires within to help [[Maisie Starhammer]] to fight past the point where her wounds should have overcome her.

After hearing [[Erol]]'s life story, [[Shol-Tak]] knows that he has had a touched life so far and everything has been given to him and he has not known sacrifice, this is something that should be remedied.

Met [[Shol-Tak]] after an encounter with some pirates out of [[Ulzek-oku]] that had travelled up the [[Ulhar River]] and had a deep and philosophical conversation with him after he saw me using my skill to heal a wounded [[Komodo Dragon]] from the opposing side.

While out in the swamp foraging for some food for [[Dobbie]], he saw [[Radrick]] throw a canvas wrapped bundle over the back of a pirate boat and sail off into the distance. When they (he and Dobbi) investigated they found [[Lukk]] wrapped up in sail cloth, he had been smuggled into [[Gronzezzeg]] but was unable to pay his passage so was dumped in the swamp to fend for himself.

[[Rask]] is looking for a [[Komodo Dragon]] and has a great looking tattoo. She respects Dobbi for his strength and prowess and I respect her for that!

Dobbi finds [[Erol]] to be amusing and as long as [[Erol]] keeps Dobbie happy [[Tirgeth]] is happy.
