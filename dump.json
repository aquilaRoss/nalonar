A crossbow bolt that automatically seeks out and targets the nearest person when fired. Please note this is almost always the person who fired the crossbow.\n* Chalk of Doors, A stick of chalk with a sprinkle of rainbow in the lime. Allows the user to cast misty step as an action by drawing a chalk door on the wall and stepping through. 3/3 uses.\n* Cloak of Grace, Allows user to cast feather fall once per day, billows majestically at all other times. On natural 1 rolls the cloak will get caught in something.\n* I'm about to give one of my players a +1 flail that's going to drop from a mimic. What the player won't know until he rolls a Nat20 on an attack is that the flail is actually a baby mimic that opens up its maw and clamps down on the target's body, but on a nat one the mimic will clamp down on the player and will need to make a strength check to pry it off or he won't be able to fight with it.\n* The Wolf’s Fang: This +1 magical longsword – with an ivory wolf’s head pommel – identifies its bearer as a friend to wolves, who will not attack the wielder unless provoked. \n* Moondancer: This +1 magical rapier is made from glittering silver steel that never rusts. Its hilt is inlaid with mother of pearl stars. When Moondancer moves through the air, the tip of the blade leaves traces of silvery light behind it. \n* Ceramite Shortsword: This +1 magical shortsword is made from magically hardened porcelain, inlaid with pale blue images of swallows in flight. The blade is impossibly sharp, but brittle. On a critical hit, roll an additional damage die. On a 1, the blade shatters into a thousand pieces and the air is momentarily filled with birdsong. \n* Prospector’s Blade: This +1 magical broadsword is of dwarven design. When the tip of this wide, squat bronze sword is tapped twice against a nonmagical metal, stone, or other mineral, the wielder learns its type. \n* Star Iron: This +1 magical longsword was forged from a meteorite. Its blade is a dark, shimmering blue, streaked with black and gold. Under starlight, the blade glows softly and feels lighter, gaining the finesse property until dawn. \n* Talon of the Crow Lord: This +1 magical longsword has a hilt adorned with feathers wrought from silver. When you attune to this weapon you can speak to and understand all crows, ravens, magpies, and other corvids, who periodically seek you out to make tiny offerings of shiny trinkets and baubles. \n* Aeolian Edge: This +1 magical rapier is exceptionally light. So light, in fact, that it will gently float away unless held or weighed down. When drawn, the bearer is surrounded by a momentary gust of wind that causes their hair and clothes to billow impressively. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about the Origin, Aesthetic, and Location of a +1 magic sword. Express its past in the craftsmanship, or in the place where it is found. Do this right and your player hasn’t just picked up a slightly better pointy stick: they’ve acquired a piece of history, a riddle from the past to solve. \n\nGiving your cleric a holy sword forged by an order of nuns to slay the demon that tormented their monastery, with a blade forged from melted down holy symbols and a hilt adorned with wax purity seals and scraps of holy scripture is a hell of a lot more evocative than saying “you find a +1 magic longsword.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","tmap.id":"76aa01ed-fd02-4109-b792-d942fde973bc","title":"Item Ideas","tags":"Object GMNote","modified":"20230202150551648","created":"20220107200014795"},{"text":"<<NPCMacro>>","tmap.id":"38cd8c6b-50c0-4667-87f0-cff393d6ddc5","title":"Izholk","tags":"Character Kobold","public":"A famous [[Kobold]] known to have trained his own [[Komodo Dragon]].","modified":"20230131112719028","image":"images/tokens/Izholk.png","hp":"16","damage":"2d10kh1+2","created":"20220105200341845","comment":"Always found with [[Izholk's Mount]]","armour":"2","abilities":"Small, Close, Reach, Forceful, Offensive, Defensive, Uncanny Endurance, Intelligent"},{"text":"<<NPCMacro>>","tmap.id":"89d42946-110e-44ba-8573-342e781ac07e","title":"Izholk's Mount","tags":"Character [[Komodo Dragon]]","modified":"20230131112537956","image":"images/tokens/Izholk Mount.png","hp":"20","damage":"2d10kh1+3 (Pierce 1)","created":"20230131112313669","comment":"Always found with [[Izholk]]","armour":"2","abilities":"Amphibious, Camouflage, Trained, Fight Humanoid, Fight Monster, Hunt, Guard, Stubborn"},{"text":"<$list filter=\"[tag[Jungle]]+[sort[]]\">\n<$link><$view field=\"title\"/></$link><br/>\n</$list>","tmap.id":"2d8ea80d-454f-4fc4-8e92-65d90b016305","title":"Jungle","modified":"20211210145625834","created":"20211210145622693"},{"text":"","tmap.id":"6f7e8ae6-66e9-4e44-9732-301ddb730b67","title":"Kantza","tags":"River Geography Lenara","modified":"20211211145527295","created":"20211211145354745"},{"text":"on the northern coast of [[Kemzemkex]]","tmap.id":"911fb3ef-69f7-4a56-8b2e-a9b967ac80b9","title":"Kemzath","tags":"[[Empire of Zantera]] Urban Town Kemzemkex","population":"6400","modified":"20220103143559539","created":"20211222184841885"},{"text":"North West.\n\n!!!
